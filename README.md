# Neighbourhood_submission


Clone the Neighbourhood repo to your local computer. Open the neighbourhood.html file and run in browser. User will see places of logding and food with their corresponding markers displayed on the web page. Use the filter to filter locations and their corresponding markers. User can click on a marker or location in the list to find out Yelp reviews that the program generates using the Yelp api. The marker also bounces and changes colour once the user clicks on a marker.
